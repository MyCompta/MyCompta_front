    <h2>Collection and Use of Information</h2>
    
    We may collect personally identifiable information from users in a variety of ways, including when users visit our site, register on the site, fill out a form, place an order, respond to a survey, and in connection with other activities, services, features, or resources we make available on our Service. Users may be asked for, as appropriate, name, email address, mailing address, phone number, and credit card information, if applicable. We will collect personal identification information from users only if they voluntarily submit such information to us. Users can always refuse to supply personally identification information, except that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Service related activities.
    
    We may also collect non-personal identification information about users whenever they interact with our Service. Non-personal identification information may include the browser name, the type of computer, and technical information about users' means of connection to our Service, such as the operating system and the Internet service providers utilized and other similar information.
    
    <h2>Protection of Information</h2>
    
    We adopt appropriate data collection, storage, and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal information, username, password, transaction information, and data stored on our Service.
    
    <h2>Sharing your Personal Information</h2>
    
    We do not sell, trade, or rent users' personally identifiable information to others. We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personally identifiable information regarding visitors and users with our business partners, trusted affiliates, and advertisers for the purposes outlined above.

    MyCompta has the discretion to update this privacy policy at any time. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page.
